# Alienator Enhanced: DMT Research Integration

*Expanding upon the original [Alienator project](https://github.com/leizerowicz/alienator) with Andrew Gallimore's cutting-edge DMT consciousness research*

## Overview

This project extends the foundational work of the Alienator framework by integrating the groundbreaking research of **Andrew Gallimore**, a computational neurobiologist and leading DMT researcher. We combine data analysis tools with theoretical frameworks from Gallimore's work on psychedelic drug technologies and consciousness exploration.

## About Andrew Gallimore's Research

Dr. Andrew Gallimore is a computational neurobiologist, pharmacologist, and author whose work bridges neuroscience, consciousness studies, and psychedelic research. His contributions include:

### Key Research Areas
- **DMT Pharmacokinetics**: Developed target-controlled intravenous infusion protocols for extended DMT experiences (collaboration with Dr. Rick Strassman, 2016)
- **Alien Information Theory**: Theoretical framework proposing psychedelics as technologies for accessing non-ordinary reality structures
- **Computational Neuroscience**: Neural basis of psychedelic drug action and consciousness
- **Reality Switch Technologies**: Psychedelics as tools for discovering and exploring new dimensional spaces

### Notable Publications & Works
- *Alien Information Theory: Psychedelic Drug Technologies and the Cosmic Game*
- *Reality Switch Technologies: Psychedelics as Tools for the Discovery and Exploration of New Worlds*
- *Death by Astonishment* (forthcoming, July 2025)
- Multiple peer-reviewed papers on DMT pharmacology and consciousness

## Project Integration

This enhanced version incorporates Gallimore's theoretical frameworks:

### 1. **Extended State Modeling**
Building on the original alienator's entity detection, we now model:
- **Breakthrough experiences** using Gallimore's pharmacokinetic models
- **Entity interaction patterns** based on reported DMT encounters
- **Consciousness state transitions** during psychedelic experiences

### 2. **Information Theory Implementation**
- **Alien Information Processing**: Algorithms inspired by Gallimore's theory that psychedelics access non-human information systems
- **Reality Switch Detection**: Identifying transition points between ordinary and non-ordinary consciousness states
- **Dimensional Mapping**: Tools for exploring the geometric and mathematical structures reported in DMT experiences

### 3. **Research Data Integration**
- Compatible with datasets from controlled DMT studies
- Integration with EEG/neuroimaging data from psychedelic research
- Support for phenomenological report analysis

## Installation

### Dependencies
```
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0

## Usage

### Basic Entity Detection (Original Alienator)
```python
from alienator import EntityDetector, ExperienceAnalyzer

# Original functionality preserved
detector = EntityDetector()
entities = detector.scan_experience_report(report_text)
```

### Enhanced DMT Analysis
```python
from alienator_enhanced import GallimoreFramework, DMTAnalyzer

# Initialize Gallimore's theoretical framework
framework = GallimoreFramework()

# Analyze DMT experience using pharmacokinetic models
analyzer = DMTAnalyzer(framework)
breakthrough_probability = analyzer.calculate_breakthrough_threshold(dose_mg=50)

# Reality switch detection
reality_switches = analyzer.detect_reality_transitions(eeg_data)

# Entity interaction analysis
entity_network = analyzer.map_entity_interactions(experience_reports)
```

### Advanced Consciousness Modeling
```python
from alienator_enhanced import ConsciousnessMapper, AlienInfoProcessor

# Map consciousness state changes
mapper = ConsciousnessMapper()
state_trajectory = mapper.model_experience_trajectory(
    dose_curve=dose_timeline,
    report_data=experience_description
)

# Process alien information patterns
info_processor = AlienInfoProcessor()
alien_patterns = info_processor.extract_non_human_information(
    visual_reports=visual_descriptions,
    auditory_reports=auditory_descriptions
)
```

## Research Applications

### Academic Research
- **Neuroscience Studies**: Integration with fMRI, EEG, and other neuroimaging data
- **Consciousness Research**: Modeling altered states and breakthrough experiences  
- **Pharmacology**: Dose-response relationship analysis using Gallimore's models
- **Anthropology**: Cross-cultural analysis of entity encounter reports

### Clinical Applications
- **Therapeutic Protocol Development**: Optimizing dosing for therapeutic outcomes
- **Safety Monitoring**: Predicting and modeling adverse reaction patterns
- **Treatment Planning**: Personalized psychedelic therapy approaches

### Theoretical Exploration
- **Reality Structure Analysis**: Testing Gallimore's theoretical frameworks with data
- **Information Theory Validation**: Empirical testing of alien information theory
- **Consciousness Cartography**: Mapping the topology of psychedelic experiences
